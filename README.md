# Password Generator Starter Code
## Description
So there's been a security breach for a popular website, and now you're on thin ice because your password may have been leaked. Or maybe your worst enemy managed to find out what your password is and has hacked your account (or is *about* to!). It can be tricky to come up with a new password, but it doesn't have to be that way. Enter the password generator!
### What did I learn from this?
I learned how to create and call functions and how create arrays and variables in JavaScript. I also learned how to use for loops and several different JavaScript commands to make my functions... well... *function* properly.
### Why did I do this?
I wanted to make it easier for people to make a new password in the occurence that someone guesses their password or their password was leaked due to a data breach.
### What problem does this solve?
This solves the problem of not knowing what your new password should be. If you're having trouble thinking of a secure password, you can try using a randomly generated one from here.
